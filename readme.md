# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Capstone

## Overview
This project was completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera)**.  
The goal is to predict whether a SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, which is critical for cost reduction and booster reuse strategy.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Retrieved SpaceX launch data using **APIs** and **web scraping**.  
- **Data Wrangling & Exploration:** Cleaned and analysed data to identify factors affecting landing outcomes.  
- **Dashboards:** Built interactive dashboards with **Plotly Dash** to visualise trends in launches, payloads, and landing success.  
- **Machine Learning:** Trained models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, and SVM to predict booster landing success.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Data Collection:** REST APIs, BeautifulSoup  
- **Dashboards & Visualization:** Plotly Dash, IBM Cognos Analytics  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks
